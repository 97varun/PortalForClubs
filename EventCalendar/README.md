# EventCalendar
* This a basic design. Please let me know what has to be added/removed.
### Run
* Download the zip and place it in ```htdocs``` folder of xampp in Windows, not sure about other operating systems
* Extract the zip and rename it to "EventCalendar"
* Open http://localhost/EventCalendar/main.html
### Todo
* Get events from database and show edit/delete buttons only to admin. I need to know how the database is created to do this. I think the events table is missing start and end. For now events are hardcoded in the php file.
* All users are shown all events. I don't know if there are multiple calendars or events are shown based on the user.
* Add event, more, edit, delete buttons etc. have to be linked to the files doing this work.
* Is there a global menu bar for our website which has to be added to this page also?
* If admin updates an event, it has to update for all users at that time.
